JavaScript variables are containers for data values<br>
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

<br>
The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:

<br>

# Accessing Object Properties
- objectName.propertyName
- objectName["propertyName"]

we can use function in object <br>
this refers to the object

**ths is not a var it is a keyword.**
<br>
Do Not Declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects!
<br>
**When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object**
