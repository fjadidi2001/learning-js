A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

<br>
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
<br>
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
<br>
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
<br>
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
<br>
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
<br>
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.
<br>
The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
<br>

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

<br>
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
<br>
If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
<br>
Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"

<br>
Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.
<br>
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
<br>
Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
